      <h2>Threat Level</h2><hr/>
      <p>
        Threat level depicts what range of a threat a subject gone rogue would exert. These estimates assume groupings have a normal distribution of military personnel throughout a civilian population. In order of severity, the threat levels are None, Average, District-Wide, City-Wide, State-Level, National Security Threat, Continental Threat, Planetary Threat, Star-System Buster, Galaxy Buster, & Universal Buster. Threat levels correspond to a range of 0-10, respectively. See the diagram (above), which depicts the current percentages of threat levels currently known.
      </p>

      <br><h2>Item Class</h2><hr/>
      <p>
        This scale is used to classify the deadliness and effectiveness of various categories of items. The scale ranges from class one items, which fit items like human-made firearms, pistols, or longswords. Class II items tend to be much more deadly, like tanks, fighter jets, bazookas, drones, etc. Class III items are beyond the capabilities of current human (known) knowledge, like shape-shifting devices or time-augmenting ones. One exception is human devices that bring about a sh*t load of devastation, such as atomic weapons or nuclear warheads. Class IV items have the potential to give the user the ability to affect reality, alter the spacetime continuum, or give someone an unreasonable amount of control over a civilization that they normally would be nowhere near able to. Class V items pose mass extinction-level threats. Class VI items put the safety of planets at risk. Finally, Class VII items are the most deadly and are effectively limitless. Anyone using a Class VII item without a permit is committing a major felony. Note, most of the class positionings are relative as this item Class scale is a relative one, and its kinks are still being worked out.<br><br>

        See the pie chart (above) for a visual depiction of current item class data.
      </p>

      <br><h2>Power Class</h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        The power class defines where a subject derives their skillset from. Currently, the three main sources of power attainment are from tech, meta capabilities, and magic. See diagram (above) for distribution of currently known power-set classes.
      </p>

      <br><h2> Durability </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        The durability of a subject is the ability to withstand combat, energy-based, or explosive-based attacks. This also includes the ability to regenerate, withstand mental manipulations, resist electrical attacks, subvert excessive ammunitions, etc. For simplicity, this skillset will be measured in psi (pound force per square inch), which is a force per unit area (lbf/in^2). Earth's atmosphere is measured at just under 15 psi. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deficient</b>: Can withstand less than 75 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Average</b>: Can withstand between 75-800 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Fighter</b>: Can withstand between 800-1500 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Apex</b>: Can withstand between 1500-10,000 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Bulletproof</b>: Can withstand between 10,000-70,000 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced</b>: Can withstand between 70,000-500,000 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Nuclear </b>: Can withstand between 500,000-1,500,000 psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Planetary</b>: Can withstand between 1.5 million - 100 quindecillion psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Nearly Indestructible</b>: Can withstand between 100 quindecillion - 1 googol psi of pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Immortal</b>: Can withstand over 1 googol of pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Energy Manipulation </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        This is defined as the ability to output, absorb, or modify energy. Energy can be emitted in the form of light, explosions, electricity, pyrotechnics, bullets, crossbows, or also by throwing massive objects. Energy will be measured in foot-pounds (ft lbs), which is the amount of energy required to apply a force of 1 pound over a foot distance. For larger energy outputs, tons of TNT will be used. This will mainly be applied to output energy for damage, but energy absorption capabilities will also be considered. Note, the most powerful nuclear bomb, aka the Tsar Bomb, emitted the equivalent of 50 megatons of TNT.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deficient</b>: Can emit less than 35 ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Average</b>: Can emit between 35-90 ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Gunslinger</b>: Can emit between 90-15,000 ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Rocketeer</b>: Can emit between 15,001-2,500,000 ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Tank</b>: Can emit between 2,500,001-5,000,000 ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamo</b>: Can emit between 5,000,001 ft·lbs - 1 kiloton of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Nuclear</b>: Can emit between 1 kiloton-50 megatons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Continental</b>: Can emit between 50 megatons-1 quadrillion tons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Planetary</b>: Can emit between 1 quadrillion - 1 nonillion tons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Star-Destroyer+</b>: Can emit over 1 nonillion tons of energy.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Intelligence</h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The intelligence of a subject is defined by their memory capacity, mental processing speed, overall brain wiring (leading to things like high-level planning and problem-solving), concentration, & the extent of their obtained knowledge. For simplicity, intelligence will be defined in terms of IQ (intelligence quotient) but may not be exact depending on the willpower and obtained knowledge of a subject. As a reference, humans have an average IQ as defined by Level 2. Each list item below corresponds to a unique level.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficient</b>: IQ is measured at less than 85.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: IQ is between 85-115.</li>
      	<li><b>Smart</b>: IQ is between 116-130.</li>
      	<li><b>Exceptional</b>: IQ is between 131-160.</li>
      	<li><b>Gifted</b>:  IQ is between 161-200.</li>
      	<li><b>Highly Gifted</b>: IQ is between 200-300.</li>
      	<li><b>Genius</b>: IQ is between 300-500.</li>
      	<li><b>Super Genius</b>: IQ is between 500-1000.</li>
      	<li><b>Beyond Genius</b>: IQ is between 1000-5000.</li>
      	<li><b>All-Knowing</b>: IQ is greater than 5000.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Psionic Powers </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        This skill set is defined by one's ability to use telekinesis, gravitational force manipulation, electromagnetic force manipulation, read minds, perform mind control on a subject, etc. For simplicity, this output will mainly pertain to external manipulations via exerting a force and will be measured in pound-force (lbf). Pound-force is the amount of force required to move a pound by the gravitational pull produced by the planet Earth.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>None</b>: Subject possesses no mental abilities .</li>
        <li><b>Enabled</b>: Can exert greater than 0 to 100 lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Levitator</b>: Can exert between 100-1,000 lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Puppet Master</b>: Can exert between 1,000-10,000 lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Bulletproof</b>: Can exert between 10,000-20,000 lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Vehicular</b>: Can exert between 20,000-100,000 lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Titanic</b>: Can exert between 100,000-100million lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Skyscraper</b>: Can exert between 100 million - 5 billion lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Continental</b>: Can exert between 5 billion - 1 quadrillion lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Planetary</b>: Can exert between 1 quadrillion - 1 nonillion lbf of force.</li>
        <li><b>Star-System+</b>: Can exert over 1 nonillion lbf of force.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Speed </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        The speed of a subject is their ability to run, fly, teleport, move, or fight fast. For simplicity, speed will be measured by overall velocity and will be quantified in mph (miles per hour), Machs, & units based off of the speed of light. Subjects who can manipulate or slow down time will also have their stats reflected in the "speed" category. Note, the fastest a human has ever traveled was just under 25,000 mph, and it was achieved during the Apollo 10 mission. Mach speed is defined by the ability to break the sound barrier. The speed of light is over 870,000 times the speed of sound.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deficient</b>: Sprinting ability is less than 15 mph.</li>
        <li><b>Average</b>: Sprinting ability is between 15-20 mph.</li>
        <li><b>Olympian</b>: Sprinting ability is between 21-30 mph.</li>
        <li><b>Apex</b>: Sprinting ability is between 31-100 mph.</li>
        <li><b>Subsonic</b>: Sprinting ability is between 100 mph-Mach 1.</li>
        <li><b>Super-Sonic</b>: Sprinting ability is between Mach 1-Mach 10.</li>
        <li><b>Speedster </b>: Sprinting ability is between Mach 10-Mach 100.</li>
        <li><b>Super Speedster</b>: Sprinting ability is between Mach 100-Mach 1000.</li>
        <li><b>Omega Level Speedster</b>: Sprinting ability is between Mach 1000-Mach 10,000.</li>
        <li><b>Lightspeed+</b>: Sprinting ability is between Mach 10,000-lightspeed & beyond.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Strength </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The strength of a subject is defined by their ability to lift heavy objects, as well as their capacity to crush and present force. For simplicity, this skillset will be measured in pounds & tons. Note, the largest object lifted by humans was the North Rankin B. Drilling platform, which weighed over 50 million pounds.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficient</b>: Lifting ability is less than 300 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: Lifting ability is between 300-500 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Strong</b>: Lifting ability is between 501-1000 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Strongman</b>: Lifting ability is between 1001-1999 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Apex</b>: Lifting ability is between 1-10 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Enhanced</b>: Lifting ability is between 10-50 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Super </b>: Lifting ability is between 50-100 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Ultra </b>: Lifting ability is between 100-1000 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Mega</b>: Lifting ability is between 1000-25000 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Limitless</b>: Lifting ability is greater than 25000 tons.</li>
      </ul>
