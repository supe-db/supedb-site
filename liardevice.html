            <h1>Origins</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The device was created by a team of scientists lead by Xavier Emecka. It has gone through a number of iterations and prototypes. It was intended to be used for military personnal to camoflouge themselves among foreign adversaries. The L.I.A.R. device has applications in the fields of spying and espionage. It also was intended as a form of imitation to mimic world leaders & install puppet goverments in foreign targets.
            </p>
            <h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The device grants the user the capability to morph into any target they have selected whether it be an electrician, plumber, constructor worker, mailman, doctor, Asian, American, European, African, Australian, etc. The device works by obscuring & refracting arrays of light beams, interpolating/estimating gaps between rays in order to generate nearly any image. This is where the device gets its name, but also for the dual purpose of allowing anyone to <i>lie</i> to another about who they really are.
            </p>
            <h1>Limitations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The device cannot transform anyone unless it has a prescanned copy of their physical structure. It also does not do anything to change an individuals composition or size, only how they appear to others. For instance, if a 5 foot tall person projects themselves as a 6-foot tall person, the additonal foot above their head is nothing but <i>smoke & mirrors</i>. The device is sensitive to temperature constraints above 150°F and below -10°F. It also cannot withstand pressures of above 3000psi. Early models also required the wearer to aid the illusion as much as possible by wearing clothes or fashioning their hair in a similiar style to the subject they are attempting to impersonate.
