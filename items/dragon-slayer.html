            <h1>Origins</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                This blade, this magnificent work of craftsmanship, this ancient weapon of power and pure devastation, was conceived some millennia ago, much before the age of man and even before the conception of a mortal being. For the Dragon Slayer has the strength, the veracity, and a bite known by few and feared by most.<br><br> 

                The Lords of Fire, a group of ancient beings, crafted this weapon in the highest land, on the highest mountain, atop the tallest structure. Lightning from the sky fused its internals together.<br><br> 

                The handle of the Dragon Slayer was constructed from the flesh of the Flame Emperor Dragon, the most powerful fire-based creature in all the land; the blade's material was melted from some ancient but nearly indestructible variety of metal; and the blade's stone, the Artex Stone, is a small, ruby-like object at the weapon's core that gives the sword its energy. Together, the three pieces bring about a force not known to any mortal. <br><br> 

                Any common man attempting to wield this weapon would disintegrate, collapsing to atoms as his mind decayed to madness and his last thought whimpered down to nothing in his head. For a weapon like this can only be wielded by those of immense strength and durability. The blade alone weighs nearly 10,000 pounds, making it a seemingly impossible object to even pick up, let alone use.<br><br> 

                Note, the current whereabouts of this item of power are unknown.
            </p>
            <h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Some fools claim that the pen is mightier than the sword. Unfortunately, none of these men have ever heard of the power given off by the Dragon Slayer Blade before. <br><br>

                With one fell swoop, the Dragon Slayer can melt an entire planet to ashes. It can slice mountains in half as if they were nothing more than a common man's loaf of bread. It is said that the heat given off from the Dragon Slayer Blade is so intense that it will turn the very core of a vibrant sun to dust. For he who wields the Dragon Slayer Blade, the most powerful fire-based weapon and one of the most powerful weapons ever conceived in history, will have to fear no man, no pen, no being of immense power, and especially not even a king.
            </p>
            <h1>Limitations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The Dragon Slayer Blade has virtually no limitations; if any, the limitations come from the one who dares bear its power. Fortunately for the living, the Dragon Slayer Blade was broken into three pieces some millennia ago; the handle was scattered to one place, the blade to another, and the stone, the Artex Stone, giving the sword its might, was locked away some time even further into the past.
