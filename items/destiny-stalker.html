            <h1>Origins</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Those that know of the Destiny Stalker's power are those that no longer exist, for the blade leaves no survivors. It's dark energy; its overwhelming force of destruction and reckless hate cannot be undone. For the blade was crafted in darkness, bred in the shadows, and nurtured in destruction. <br><br>

                The Dark Ones, an evil group of hideous sorcerers from eons ago, bled their black magic and their life force into this sword. The red gems in the Destiny Stalker's core are the stones of the most powerful darkness and demonic creature in existence. <br><br> 

                The pommel of the handle is constructed from the eye of Medusa herself, turning all those that look upon it to marble. This supposedly metal-looking ocular apparatus (on the pommel) can come to life, see, and even move. It can communicate telepathically with the Destiny Stalker's wielder. <br><br>

                As of now, this weapon, which is capable of dominating all life, is owned by the wickedest being in all the landâ€”Darconica. He uses the sword to conquer worlds and bring about mass devastation. <br><br>

                Note, not only is the Destiny Stalker the most powerful darkness weapon, it is the most powerful weapon (in general) in existence.
            </p>
            <h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                It would be far easier to talk about what the Destiny Stalker can't do than what it can.
            </p>
            <h1>Limitations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The Destiny Stalker makes its wielder limitless, and since all users are all limitful, the blade must not be. This weapon is the strongest and most powerful item for this series and for all series to come. Like its cousin sword, the Dragon Slayer, the limits of the blade are derived from the wielder. <br><br>

                Note, the Destiny Stalker is the heaviest sword and most difficult to control; only those who are all-powerful and all-evil dare even try.
