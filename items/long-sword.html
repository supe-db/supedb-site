            <h1>Origins</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                These weapons were crafted during the Third Age in the Kingdom of Ali by one of the many on-staff blacksmiths. It is a good sword but not a great sword. This blade is not intended for high generals or royal leadership, but it works just fine for cavalier men. In fact, it was because of this weapon that the kingdom was able to fend off the Vulktor invaders during the end of the 3rd age. <br><br>

                These swords are still manufactured today, but crossbows, spears, or explosive contraptions are preferred.
            </p>
            <h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                This sword has no exceptional powers or abilities; in fact, it is a Class I item, the lowest of the classes. It has no advanced pieces of technology or foreign magic giving it a boost. However, it did serve its purpose during the many wars of the kingdom of Ali. Long swords were even the preferred combat item of choice back then, as poorer citizens resorted to using long sticks, primitive tools, metal bars, throwing rocks, or common household objects.
            </p>
            <h1>Limitations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                This sword has no inherent limitations other than its enormous size and mass, making it a good weapon for large and strong soldiers only.
