            <h1>BackStory</h1> <hr/>
            <p>
                Former Russian and proud Soviet, Klaus was forced to defect after his parents sought a better life for him (despite countless protests) and themselves in America. There, his parents used their extensive wealth to drown Klaus in anything he possibly needed or wanted, from video games to new shoes.<br><br>

                However, unlike his two sisters, who became prominent real estate moguls in their own right, Klaus had a strong passion for the sciences, particularly computer engineering. When Klaus was no more than the age of twelve, he had already hacked into the computer systems of his school to lower the grades of his enemies. He would have increased his own scores too if they were not already 'perfect marks'.<br><br>

                After graduating from MIT with a Ph.D. in computer engineering, Klaus sought an extensive career at New World Technologies in the networking and cyber security department. There, he is able to experiment on tech to hack computer systems or algorithms used to generate deadly viruses. Either are intended to be used in technological warfare.
