			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Not much is known about this character profile. What is known is he has ties to the Russian empire and possibly the Soviet Union based on the engravings that he bares on his arms—a Soviet star on one side and a sickle on the other.<br><br>

				His motivations also seem unclear; if anything, his journeys throughout time challenging the Americans seem to personify a modern-day version of the 1960s space race. Of course, the main difference being this occurrence deals with time as opposed to space.<br><br>

				Based on numerous investigations by various sources, it is believed that this man is highly unstable and thus should be avoided at all costs. Particularly of note is his rather extensive collection of knives that he carries at all times. Some of the blades are even energized by some variant of Gamma-induced energy repulsions. 
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Russian’s affiliations are unknown. Based on some analysis by various International Affairs departments, it is believed that the Russian has strong ties to the Kremlin, Russia at large, and possibly the KGB. Whether he has any connections to Russian presidential aspirations is unknown.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Time Machine:</b> This allows an individual to return to the exact time and location in which a picture was taken.</li>
				<li><b>Time Augmenting Device:</b>  This contraption freezes time temporarily for everyone except the wielder. It seems to have a range exceeding 100 yards.</li>
				<li><b>Homing Beacon:</b>  When activated, this contraption returns a time-traveler to his home time.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sonic Repulsion System:</b>  This item is a dual-action high-concentration wave generator. The waves are spawned from two gauntlets. When activated large metal spikes protrude from each of the gauntlets. This weapon has only been seen to deter large repulsive blasts and not create any of its own.
				</li>
				<li><b>High-Energy Knives:</b>These weapons are a foot long and 3.5 inches thick at their peak. They closely resemble the blade of a bowie enough, except their edge is powered by 30 milligrams of pure liquid Zirconium-9 (the densest metal known to exist). </li>
				<li><b>Flesh Mask</b>:  This mask is presumably made out of the flesh of the Russian’s fallen victims. It was stitched together with thick thread and smells of blood. Its main purpose is to conceal the identity of its bearer. This mask along with some primitive noise manipulation technology give the impression that the Russian has some mental manipulation & intimidation advantages over his adversaries. This explains why his "Mental Powers" stat is nonzero.</li>
				<li><b>Black Exoskeleton:</b> Although the substance of the suit is unknown, it is believed it is made of high-intensity Kevlar. The material resembles Class-2 Armor produced by New World Technologies with some impact resistant modifications made by their bearer.  </li>
