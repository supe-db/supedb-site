		<h1> Welcome to SupeDb...</h1>
		<p>
			A database consisting of super-powered beings also known as <i>supes</i>. This site classifies supes into three distinct categories: meta humans, magic users, and technological based origins. See the <a href="powerIndex.html">Power Index</a> page to learn more. This page also speaks on the threat levels each supe poses whether they be a danger at the local level, state level, national level, globally etc. It also contains a writeup of the different attributes used to classify supes: intelligence, strength, speed, durability, energy manipulation, & mental powers. Pie charts are used on this page as well to show various distributions visually. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The <i>Character</i> Page documents all superheroes, supervillains, anti heroes, anti villains, and their associates. "Enhanced" characters have a statistical breakdown of their various attributes such as Strength, Speed, & Intelligence on their respective pages. Physical & personal attributes of characters is also described. Additionally, some back story information & affiliation info is included too. The <i>Items</i> Page and the <i>Geo</i> page offer somewhat analogous information for various items of significance* and planetary locations respectively. The <i>Credits</i> Page cites sources used to help create the content of this webpage. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the main intent of this site is to share stories and accounts of the various supes & super-powered beings throughout the universe (as described mainly in the various Character pages).
			See below for a summary about the long and gruely tale of Michael Preston, hero of the past, preserver of the future, and protector of yesteryear—the Yesterday Man:
		</p>
		<blockquote> <!-- Inline-like quoting text tag-->
			If you had the power to change the past, would you? At what cost?<br><br>
			One man has this ability, and he's not afraid to show the whole world of his discovery. His name is Michael Preston and he's a 'f@*king time traveler'. A man that single handledly figured out a way to journey back into the past to the exact time and location in which a photograph was taken. Now achieving this feat may seem impossible, incomprehenisible to the common man, or even, irresponsible, but to Michael it was inevitable, he just needed to execute. Time traveling was what he was born to do, it's what made Michael happy. Now he could spend the rest of his days glorified by the limelight—saving desperate and lustful damsels in distress, perhaps, the world too, and maybe even make it home in time for Claire Preston's famous apple crisp. Simple right?<br><br>
			Not exactly.
