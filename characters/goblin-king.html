			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Lurek Gewld, the living embodiment of greed and deception, was born in a pile of dirt and mud, with his mother spitting at his springy infant body. Now for most races, this would be a horrible way to enter this world, a most unfortunate introduction, but for a goblin, a nasty, greedy goblin that is, it was utter perfection. Lurek was born a prince of a kingdom of stench; he just did not know it yet.<br><br>

				Throughout his young adulthood Lurek was taught the ways of his goblin folkâ€”war, greed, corruption, espionage, thievery, and lying were but a few of the goblin vices. And inevitably Lurek grew up to embody those principles wholly, taking command of the kingdom, suppressing his people, and breeding machines of war.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Lurek is affiliated with the Goblin Kingdom, in which he is his kinfolk's one true ruler and master (and he never lets them forget it).
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Goblin King's race gives him superior strength, speed, and durability; however, he is quite lazy, often relying on his servants to do everything for him. The Goblin King spends the majority of his days eating, sitting, barking orders, scheduling executions, and eating some more. Due to this sedentary lifestyle, his physical stats have suffered, although the Goblin King was gifted with great intelligence as compared to his fellow goblins. <br><br>

				The legion of goblins he governs also greatly helps his threat level. Goblins may not be the brightest species, but they are still quite mischievous and tricky and can be quite a formidable force to command.
