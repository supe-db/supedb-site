			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Velga Vitra, otherwise known as the Grand Leader High Chancelloress Supreme of the Galaxy or High Chancelloress Supreme for short, rules her planet with a fiery tongue and cutthroat grip. She was born a thousand years ago and raised by her society to become their queen, to serve with the royal family, and to guide the populace to their destiny. Her people followed her every word she ever spoke, and if not, they would not be around much longer to disobey her next order. <br><br>

				With the help of her father, she bred the greatest Armada Vilgamax (Velga's planet) had ever seen. Once the Armada was complete, Velga had her father assassinated and took full control of the throne. There she announced her planet's conquest to dominate all life, to travel the galaxy in search of civilization, and to force them to become her servants or be destroyed. <br><br>

				The only thing Velga needed now was the Artex Stone, a seemingly limitless energy source that can power her Eliminator Cannon, a weapon that, when fully charged with the Artex Stone, can obliterate a planet.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Velga is affiliated with Vilgamax's Armada, a ruthless, highly trained fleet of Vilgamax's finest soldiers. The fleet consists of hundreds of spaceships flown by Vilgamaxians, a bug-like people with a taste for destruction.<br><br>

				Velga is also associated with other planet-conquering civilizations, and she often speaks with them through intergalactic conferencing communications. The other planet's leaders believe Velga is not ready to join their alliance since she has not conquered a single planet thus far.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Velga has advanced strength, speed, and durability due to her race and genetically modified (royal) upbringing. She also has a supreme intellect, and when combined with the resources of her people, she was able to design the Eliminator Cannon, a weapon that has the potential to destroy planets with one clean shot. Other gizmos she has created over the years include density-modifying technologies that give Velga the ability to fly and various other weapons used by her Armada.<br><br>

				The source of her energy and psionics stat is derived from her Armada. Also, her yellow stat bars are explained by the Eliminator Cannon, a planet-destroying weapon of mass destruction and total mayhem.
