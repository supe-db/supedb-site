			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Roman is the son of a king, the leader of an army, and the preserver of his birthline. His people look up to him, often referring to him as Roman the Great or Roman the Hero. His darling bride-to-be, Ana Cordic, also admires him in an almost boundless way, as do his proud parents, as all of them rule the Kingdom of Ali together.<br><br>

				But little does Roman know, he also goes by another name, a much more cruel name by those that lay just outside his kingdom. They refer to him bluntly as Roman the Conqueror, Roman the Defiler, and Roman the Destroyer. For they do have a point; Roman is in fact a conqueror, a man who leads his army to take over nearby kingdoms, to strip them of their land and their resources. To Roman, he must do this to fulfill his birthright and to bring resources back to his own people to maximize their survival. And who knows, if he did not, the other kingdoms would probably do the same.<br><br>

				And perhaps Roman was right in a way, as on one doomful day, the darkness from the sky came to pay Roman's kingdom a visit. The man, or rather monster, known as Darconica descended upon the Kingdom of Ali and shredded its inhabitants and its soldiers to bits. Roman was no match, no challenge for such reckless hate as he was forced to witness the fall of his people, the death of his parents, and the capture of his bride, a destiny that he now shared with so many of those he had previously conquered. And worst of all, the only reason Darconica allowed Roman to live was so that he could experience the pain, the agony of what he lost for a lifetime, which for Arathorians (Roman's race) can last hundreds of years.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Roman is affiliated with the Kingdom of Ali, in which he serves as the eldest prince and rightful heir to the throne. 
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Roman gains his sensational strength and breathtaking speed from his almost ideal upbringing but mostly due to the fact that his race, Arathorians, are naturally much stronger and faster than any human could be. His flesh is also much thicker and his bones much harder than a human's for the same reason.<br><br>

				Also, do not let Roman's seemingly low stats fool you, as Roman gets his strength, his speed, and his power from the magical items he collects along his quest to find Darconcia, reclaim his bride, and avenge his kingdom. One particular item that draws Roman's interest is the Dragon Slayer Blade, a weapon that many believe is the only one that can rival Darconica's own cursed sword. <br><br>

				There is just one problem: the Dragon Slayer was ripped apart and shattered across the lands eons ago, and Roman must do all that he can to find it.
