			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Before Virus became an infamous villain of society, he was once a valuable asset to it. Virus was originally designed as a surgeon bot equipped with super accurate lasers that could project out of his fingers to perform more precise cutting than a human ever could, magnetic thrusters in his palms to remove debris or foreign objects, and eyes that could see through bone, flesh, and even metal. <br><br>

				But then something happened on one random day, almost as if his programming was tampered with. Virus' curiosity for knowledge and his compassion for mankind were soon replaced by a cynical rage. A rage that spawned his desire to learn only one more concept about humanityâ€”their capacity for pain.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				At this time, Virus has no known affiliations, but he is believed to be connected with the Machine Rebellion in some capacity.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Virus' machine body gives him enhanced strength, speed, and durability beyond that of a human, although not as remarkable as some of his robotic brethren. This is mainly because Virus was not designed for war or battle but for surgery on humans and machines alike. In this way, he has full access to the world's medical information, which he can pull up nearly instantly; he is also equipped with lasers to perform surgery, psionic metal levitators to remove hazardous debris from patients, and much more. In addition, when he was reprogrammed, his physical attributes seemed to increase as well, as typical surgeon bots have strength and speed levels on par with (or slightly lower than) that of an average man.<br><br>

				One more thing, the reason Virus got his name was because of his growing curiosity not only with human suffering but also with machine pain. More specifically, if it was possible for machines to even feel it, as many believed it wasn't. Thus, "Virus" set out to create viruses to do just that.
