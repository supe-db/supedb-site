			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Remmy had it all: the perfect girl, the perfect kids, the perfect job, the perfect home, and the perfect parents. That was Remmy's lifeâ€”simply perfect. Now you may be wondering, that doesn't sound like a typical superhero tale of a strong, brave man who loses his parents while he is still way too young. A kid who has everything taken from him that he ever loved before he even knew what he lost. A boy who seeks nothing but vengeance. <br/><br/>

				Huh. You caught me. <br/><br/>

				Remmy's life was perfect until the day of his big sale, his big break, a day that was supposed to be, you guessed it, perfect. Remmy got a not-so-perfect call from a not-so-ideal doctor. It was about his aunt; well, to Remmy, it was his mother, as she is the one who raised him. Aunt Maria had stage four cancer. A single thud sounded off afterward, as a phone pounded against the floor while Remmy went speechless.

			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Remmy is affiliated with various medical groups in a volunteer capacity, desperate to find a cure for his aunt's illness.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Remmy gets his powers in a somewhat unusual and criminalesque scenario. It all happened during one bad heist involving a boatload of supposedly toxic chemicals. Their combination at just the right time granted him what many would deem a gift (although Remmy considers it more of a curse, a curse to suffer endlessly, unable to cease to be). <br/><br/>

				Because of this incident, Remmy was given the ability to adapt to anything, literally. Bullets, jumps from skyscrapers without a parachute, lion attacks, you name it, he just could not be put down. And not only can he adapt to anything, he can mimic the abilities of others, like the paws of a wolf, the fangs of a lion, and the speed of a cheetah, or even the wraith of a champion; all he needs to do is have one encounter with them.
