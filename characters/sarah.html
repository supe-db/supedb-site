            <h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                What if you could live forever? What would you do with your life, and how would you behave differently if your days were not numbered. That was something Sarah had on her mind since she was a small child. She always felt life, whether human or that of an insect, was too delicate, too fractional, and needed to be preserved. From then on began her interest in the science of aging. She sought to delay it or rather halt it. And so began her studies in the fields of both physics and biologic-based cryogenics. <br><br>

                After attending Boston College, she made way in developing a temporary drug that increased the average lifespan of a short-lived bacterium from ten days to two months.<br><br>

                After receiving her Ph.D. in biological cryogenics, she went out to get a job at New World Technologies. There she would use her expertise to develop drugs for soldiers capable of expanding their prime/youth, increasing their healing time, and de-aging both their body and their mind.

            <h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Sarah is a new hire at New World Technologies. She is currently working in the cryogenics biology department. Her past employment history is unknown as is a lot about her character profile. It is not clear whether this is by design or if someone is watching over her. Her affiliations with foregin adversaries is also unknown and it may be possible that she is working with some nation like Russia, China, or North Korea. Although this is unlikely due to the fact she is under active investigation in order to receive a clearance from the United States of America.
