			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Diablo is a demon <i>boy</i> and first son of Lucifer, the King of the Underworld. Diablo has been bred by his father to fulfill his one true purposeâ€”corrupt the minds of humanity so when they pass, they will be part of the Underworld and join the ranks of Lucifer's army. <br/><br/>

				Diablo's technique for achieving this is by using mirrors as a gateway between his world and the world of humanity. Unsuspecting victims must chant the demonic rhyme of Diablo in front of a mirror to summon him. Once there, Diablo finishes his target, as the mere call of his name has indicated his victim has already betrayed the virtue of the living. <br/><br/>

				There is just one problem, a rather troublesome being known as Ester, Diablo's sister. Ester (unlike her peers) has modernized her approach to possession and haunting by using the screens of electronics such as smartphones, tablets, and computers to enter the human world, making her chances for emergence highly more probable than her brother's. <br/><br/>

				As the stakes rise and Ester's success continues to overshadow Diablo's, Lucifer considers obsoleting Diablo and even suggests banishing him to the Outer Realm if he does not improve his <i>numbers</i>, along with the likes of other failures like the <i>Lighthouse Keeper</i>.<br/><br/>

				Now Diablo just has to decide what to do and whether to try to adapt or give in to the inevitable instead.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Diablo is affiliated with the Underworld, a place of great hate and torment. To its core, the underworld is wrapped up into 9 layers of pure devastation, in which Diablo has properly held his station at Layer 5, Wraith, where he can unleash the full power of his rage.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Diablo has an immense and thick demonic hide, capable of withstanding the blast of a nuclear explosion. He also has an aura of evil surrounding his body, further protecting him from external damage. In terms of energy projections, Diablo is a master of pyro-theatrics capable of launching fiery convulsions equivalent to that of early human atomic bombs. When Diablo is in a primal state (indicated by the yellow stats marker), Diablo has the ability to emit flames powerful enough to disrupt a planet's crust and tear holes in its tectonic plates.<br/><br/>

				In terms of psionics, Diablo has been granted primitive telekinetic and mind-warping powers typical of many demons and possessors of his age. They grant Diablo the ability to levitate small objects, humans, and even the occasional grandmother intended to scare, not maim, his victims. Diablo is also able to get into his victim's head, making them see things that are not there and perceive sensations that do not exist.<br/><br/>

				Diablo's speed and strength are also quite exceptional, making him appear as a blur of darkness to his victims, quickly zipping around faster than most can perceive. His immense strength is capable of lifting up to 100 tons, although Diablo often does not use even close to this amount of power with humans, nor does it come in much use against other demonic beings, as many of them do not occupy a physical presence.
