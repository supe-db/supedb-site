			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				A born soldier was the phrase many would speak of when referring to Andrew R. Liepman. He stood his ground through 3 military tours, 5 near-death experiences, and 1 global war. <br><br>

				On one particular exhibition, he served on the front lines proudly, gunning down his foes with ease in a land he knew very little of. The mission was going exactly as expected until a new set of infantrymen had come, of the likes that Andrew had never witnessed before in all his years of service. These men were dressed entirely in black, thick armor, with tubing running from their mouths to their back pods. Bullets did nothing to them, but what they fired back was the most horrifying thing Andrew had ever seen, and he had witnessed people blown to nothing in the past. <br><br>

				Whatever serum (in their bullets) these new enhanced enemy soldiers were using was turning Andrew's fellow patriots into metal, purifically solidified sculptures, transforming them in the most painful way possible. Andrew had never heard screams like he heard on that one fateful night. <br><br>

				And it was not long for Andrew's destiny to be one and the same with his fellow warfighters as he was struck by the serum, having been made victim to its agonizing transforming concoction. <br><br>

				This chemical, MV1, was devised for one purpose: intimidation. It provided a perfectly convenient way for its creator to conceal his victims in metal and display them as his war trophies in his garden. <br><br> 

				But unfortunately for the serum's inventor, there was one major flaw. At the exact moment Andrew was hit by the serum, a bolt of lightning struck down upon the land, zapping Andrew's flesh. The combination of MV1 and the electric blast warped Andrew's body in an unimaginable way, transforming him into a man of both flesh and metal who could summon lightning by the mere force of his will. <br><br>

				In a way, Andrew had become the modern incarnation of Frankenstein's monster.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Andrew is affiliated with the Renegade, a team of four other supered-up dudes. The other members include the Blurr, Sky Blazer, the Extraterrestrial, and Vain.<br><br>

				As a side note, Steel Thunder was originally calling himself the Steel Bolt and later the Metallic Thunder before joining the team. Realizing he had wasted too much time on picking an alter ego, he opted for a name that matched that of the old tanks he used to ride into battle. Plus the alias was a perfect fit for Andrew, given his ability to control both lightning and metal.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Steel Thunder has the ability to summon electricity from the sky and later even generate it from his own being. He also can control metal with his mind. In some cases, he can even mix the combination of the two together, dealing one f@*k ton of a load of devastation. For instance, Steel Thunder can summon metal spikes out of the ground to pin his opponents into position, and then he can call upon lightning to strike down and target those same metal spikes. Steel Thunder can also create canals of metal in the ground and direct and concentrate pure streams of electric energy through them.<br><br>

				In later states, Steel Thunder became one with the greater beyond, in which he could shift entire metal-based planets with his mind and summon electricity from the core of the Electric Universe.<br><br>

				In another state, Steel Thunder can sacrifice his metal-bending abilities to become that of pure electric energy, giving him the ability to fight his foes at lightspeed and beyond.
