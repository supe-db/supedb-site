			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				His race was eradicated, his people vaporized in a large flash of light, and he was the only survivor, the ultimate survivor. Ozar was not the strongest, the fastest, or the smartest of his people, but now he was his people. <br><br>

				So Ozar did what he had to do to avenge his fallen brethren. He used his superior intellect (although not greater than that of his countrymen, but far above humans) to reconstruct what he could, dedicating all his time and energy to war, as he had nothing left to do or anyone around to spend time with. After many years of perfecting his designs, Ozar built an army of Mechamites, which are a mechanical group of 4-limbed (2-arm, 2-legged) machines bred for war. With his army completed, he was ready for revenge and now had the force to back up his rage. <br><br>

				As a side note, Ozar's appearance and demeanor may scream of some foreign creature conceived from the depths of the underworld; however, he was not always like that. He once greatly resembled that of a human, the main difference being he had one large eye in the center of his head instead of 2 smaller ones. Ozar was essentially the non-monsterific version of a cyclops. However, when experimenting on himself in order to increase his physical attributes in the lab, things went horribly wrong, turning Ozar into the creature he is today, the one-eyed, tentacle-bearing, green-skinned being that many civilizations have learned to fear.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Ozar is affiliated with the Mechamites, a robotic, super-advanced, and deadly civilization of his design. The Mechamites are a legion of roughly 5,000 soldiers with mechanical skeletons and sheets of white padding covering their interiors. Some of the soldiers lack legs and hover above the ground instead via the use of jet propulsion. 
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Due to experiments on himself that mutated his very being, the One Eye gained enhanced durability, speed, and strength. <br><br>

				The One Eye can also form a highly concentrated and unstable beam of energy from his eye that has more power than a nuclear explosion. This beam, when initiated, only travels in a straight line, but it cannot be stopped once it is set in motion, capable of reaching near infinite amounts of energy if tested.  <br><br>

				The One Eye is also an extremely intelligent individual from an extremely intelligent race of people. <br><br> 

				His daunting presence and his spacecraft's beaming/semi-teleportation ability give him a psionics boost.  <br><br>

				Lastly, One Eye's ship armada and army of Mechamites at his disposal slightly boost his stats but aren't by any means fully accounted for.
