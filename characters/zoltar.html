			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zoltar was born a servant to the Goblin King, a wicked ruler who forced the poorest among the goblins to either work in the fields without compensation (in horrendous conditions) until their deaths or, much more cheerfully, to fight in the goblin armies to capture or besiege foreign lands in honor of the king, also to their deaths. Either way, the royalty amongst the tribe could enjoy all the luxuries they desired and the long lives that came with them, while the lesser among them did nothing but serve. <br><br>

				And as so many goblins desired, Zoltar, a notable servant among them, chose the fields and seemingly endless labor. If anything, he wanted to enjoy what little life he would be given without having to worry about being impaled by a spear, or shot with an arrow, or, again, stabbed by a sword. But unfortunately for Zoltar, the Goblin King had other plans, instead opting to send Zoltar to the front lines. <br><br>

				There Zoltar confronted a great army from the Kingdom of Ali. The battle was fierce between them and the goblins, as many lives were lost on both sides, fighting to their respective demises. The two armies clashing initially resembled a relentless force meeting an unstoppable legion. <br><br>

				But despite this, and unfortunately for the goblin folk, the overall battle was short-lived, with the Arathorians from the Kingdom of Ali emerging victorious. <br><br>

				After the king from the Kingdom of Ali waged victory, he offered Zoltar a choice: to serve his kingdom and spy for him personally on his council in exchange for his life and a fairly nourished one at that. Zoltar, who originally resented non-goblins as he was taught, accepted in a somewhat relieved manner.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zoltar is affiliated with the Kingdom of Ali, in which he serves as an advisor to the King of Ali. He achieved this role after completing multiple successful espionage missions on behalf of the king.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zoltar's goblin roots give him somewhat advanced durability, speed, and strength, but the real kicker is his mind. Zoltar is one of the smartest among the goblins, and he will always do what he has to do to survive, no matter how cruel.
