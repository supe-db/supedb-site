			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Before the beginning, there was the End, a being of immense power and darkness, haunting all those who dare speak his name. The end is a supervillain to rule all other supervillains. A being capable of unimaginable feats of strength and power. The only thing that is known about the End are the worlds he has destroyed. With one beam of energy, he is able to explode planets or, in some cases, entire star systems. Thousands of planets hosting civilizations of thriving life have been halted, disrupted, and obliterated after thousands of years of prosperity all because of one encounter with the End, one bad day, one final day. </br> </br>

				The End does not speak unless to torment his victims, to make their last moments their most painful and agonizing, a pain that most would not experience in a lifetime compiled down into one second, a flash of utter destruction. It is believed that the End feeds on the energy of some of his more powerful victims, keeping them alive, clinging to life, only to be summoned again in order for the End to draw mana from them.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				There are no known affiliations at this time.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The End has the power to wipe out entire star systems in the palms of the claws he calls hands. He can generate megatons of TNT of force at will and at any moment. His speed is akin to that of light. Within the blink of an eye, he can travel around Earth-sized planets many times. <br/><br/>

				At this time, the End is thought to be immortal or nearly indestructible, but this cannot be confirmed; hence, his ranking of '9' for durability. The End has enough strength to lift entire continents, stripping them from a planet if he so deems. <br/><br/>

				The End most likely has many more darker and more devious abilities that are not known yet. Only time will tell, but if any new abilities become active, this page will be updated.
