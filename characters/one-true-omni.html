			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Every ten billion years to the nearest yottasecond, the One True Omni makes his appearance for one purpose and one purpose alone: to wipe out the multiverse. <br><br>

				Now you may be asking yourself how someone could be so evil, so cruel, or so heartless. Unfortunately that is the wrong question, for the One True Omni is not evil, he is not cruel, and he certainly is not heartless; he is just cursed with limitless knowledge of what can be, what will be, what has been, what will always be, and what is. <br><br>

				You see, the multiverse is finite, and thus the planets capable of sustaining life are as well, but the amount of life, the sheer number of unique individuals that can exist, is not. Thus, every ten billion years the One True Omni comes to pave the starways clean, to destroy what has been and what was in order to create a new multiverse born out of hope. A multiverse that will spawn seemingly endless (but not quite so) universes teeming with life.<br><br>

				Also, the One True Omni, despite being seemingly all-powerful, is not all cruel. This is because he warns all life of the impending destruction of the multiverse exactly ten days before its reckoning and that their final week and a half will be their last. <br><br>

				Thus, they should close up loose ends and do with their final days what they please.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The One True Omni is affiliated with everything and everyone in the multiverse and with nothing and no one at the same time.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Ha, this section was not made for characters of this power level or of this magnitude. The original power index was set at a range of 0 to 10. Zero being below average, 1 being average, 2 being district-level, 3 being city-level, 4 being state-level, 5 being a nation-buster, 6 being a continent-buster, 7 being a planet-buster, 8 being a star-system buster, 9 being a galaxy-buster, and 10 being a universe-buster. <br><br>

				Since the One True Omni is capable of threating the entire multiverse, a new power index rating was created just for him, 11, which stands for a multiverse-buster.
