    		<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
    		<p>
    			Xavier was born and raised in an orphanage not because he had no parents but because his mother was the primary caretaker at one (Mary Emeka). She brought him up and taught him lessons that he would not understand the full gravity of until much later. Unfortunately, she passed when Xavier was only fifteen years old. <br><br>

    			Despite not having any parents left to support him (that he knew of at least) and growing up in poverty, Xavier put all that behind him to focus on the sciences. One particular science that drew his attention was experimental physics (mainly derived from his love of science fiction movies). Xavier’s dissertation, main focus, and thesis as a grad student were under a sub-branch of experimental physics known as optics, where he developed preliminary technologies capable of modifying and augmenting the appearance of ordinary objects.<br><br>

    			After graduating Harvard with a Ph.D., Xavier took a prestigious role as an optical engineer at New World Technologies. A few years later, he got his bright but somewhat insane friend, Michael Preston, a job there.
    		</p>
    		<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
    		<p>
    			Xavier is a staff member at New World Technologies in a leading role, mentoring a team of 20-25 young physicists. He is also a member of <i>Read for the Stars</i>, an organization that helps young kids struggling in school to read and write.
