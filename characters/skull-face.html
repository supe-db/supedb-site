			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Put them down, slowly, Rico would sometimes whisper to his lead provocateurs. He needed to send a message; he needed to lay his fist down like a block of iron. He could not let the other gangs in town make it look like Rico had gone soft. If he did think that, then they would start getting out of line, they would become a little more ballsy, and maybe even take a stop on Rico's territory and start stealing his customers. Rico may seem like a typical gang leader, but he always did things for a reason. He only showed as much cruelty as he had to to get his point across, to keep the lines between his rule and some other compadre clear and thick. <br><br>

				In a way, Rico is a simple man with one clear goal: keeping things as they are, as they were, and how they always will be. Oh, and he also wears a skull mask, something that not only symbolizes his gang and strikes fear into his targets, but also offers a layer of protection from bats, knives, and somewhat from bullets.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Rico is the leader of the Skull Gang, a typical drug-peddling, no-good, and somewhat underground crime group.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Rico has no superpowers, as he is only human; however, he is among the most athletic on the planet. He is able to deadlift just over 1,000 lbs. He also is able to fight at devastatingly fast speeds, just as fast or faster than many top boxers, which is the source of his speed stat. Rico gets his durability buff from the heavy body armor he sometimes wears. The source of his energy stat is derived from the various firearms he carries, and also his bazooka doesn't hurt things.
