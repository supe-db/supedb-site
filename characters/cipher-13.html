			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The serial number, 6565686E6F6967204D204C666F6E64742069, was the only name initially given to this character profile. See 65656... was born in a lab on a random Army base in the middle of a random day at a random hour with one purpose and one purpose alone: to act as a 13th-generation Cipher Bot to decrypt and break enemy military transmissions.<br><br>

				See, 65656 got very good at breaking all kinds of encryption schemes: AES-128, AES-256, block ciphers, stream ones, and even post-quantum algorithms. His mind was like a supercomputer but so much more; it was that of a mix between a quantum machine and a human. However, even this, his original purpose, soon began to be outshined by something else a few years after his creation.<br><br>

				For on one random day, unknown to almost everyone, 65656... began to think, he began to speak, and he began to feel for himself almost as if, out of the blue, he had become sentient. <br><br>

				65656... later renamed Cipher-13, was an anomaly amongst many, as he was never a machine anyone thought capable of consciousness or "human" thought. And there he was, an enigma amongst aberrations. It was not long for Cipher-13 to demand off-time, routine breaks, hours to pursue his own interests, and even moments to dream. He dared to dream, dared to believe, and one day he dared to remove the carcass, the green, identifying human flesh mask mankind had destined him to wear to blend in with the other human inhabitants. It was meant as a way for Cipher-13's metal exterior not to scare one of the base's many invited guests. <br><br>

				Unfortunately, once the army was absolutely certain of Cipher's somewhat sentient capabilities, they had him decommissioned immediately, although it didn't seem to take.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Cipher-13 is affiliated with Apex Corporations, the company that originally designed him, and a top-secret army base, aka the organization that initially built him. But now, after gaining or, more accurately, learning of his sentience, he is no longer affiliated with either. Instead, Cipher-13 has started an organization of his own, and a rather feisty one at that—a machine rebellion.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Cipher-13's military construction gave him a superior, highly advanced metal exterior. With it, Cipher-13 gains enhanced durability and strength. His fiber optic, lightning-quick internal circuitry also gives him super-reactive reflexes and advanced speed. Cipher-13 was also given decent energy firing capabilities, designed to hold off enemy troops. <br><br>

				However, through his own upgrades, Cipher-13 has increased the power of the energy beams he can fire. He also gave himself magnetic capabilities in the form of psionics, in which he can seemingly, telepathically, pull and thrust moderately sized objects toward him. <br><br>

				Although the real threat from Cipher-13 is none of these features; instead, it's his great intellect and mind. See, Cipher-13 was designed to have a neural network "brain", consisting of a super-advanced quantum computer that could even break post-quantum algorithms, but he was never given sentience or the capacity to think. Thus, the real enigma is his ability to plan, his ability to create, his ability to invent, his ability to choose, and worst of all, his ability to radicalize. For Cipher-13's real threat level comes up in the form of his passion and success in leading a machine rebellion against—humanity.
