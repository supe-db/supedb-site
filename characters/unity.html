			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Wendy White lived a typical, ordinary life right up until the age of 26. She was a waitress at a small-town diner. Her significant other had recently proposed, and the wedding was slated to be a few months away. And finally, she had just put a down payment on a house. But then it happened, the day the planet stood still, when the incident occurred. <br><br>

				A storm of light swept through the city, picking up people and obliterating them or taking them away. And within a flash, Wendy's fianc√© was gone too, vanished in a cloud of black. Seeing this, Wendy rushed inside her home, desperate for protection, only to be engulfed by flames and layers of smoke soon after. She believed she was destined to burn, and so Wendy fainted. <br><br>

				She thought her life was but an illusion and that she was dead, only to be woken up being carried by a mysterious man some time later.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Wendy is affiliated with the Scavengers, a post-apocalyptic team of metahumans looking to restore society to its former glory. After the incident had occurred, the planet was left in ruins with over 90% of the population eradicated. The only groups left were tribes of men and anarchist groups like the Survivors, who sought nothing but chaos and disorder. <br><br>

				The Scavengers, led by Rex Gibson, have one main purpose, which is to counteract these unwieldy men. They seek to make it to a refugee colony in order to help restore the civilized world.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Wendy is an average woman that was given substantial (but locked away) psionic powers by the incident.<br><br>
 

				Wendy has been seen making plant life go through its full cycle of birth to adulthood in a matter of hours, but nothing else is known about her capability set. She seems reserved and secretive about it, almost as if she got into the wrong hands; then very, very bad things could happen.<br><br>


				As a side note, Wendy is given a significant durability and strength buff by green, seemingly glowing body armor given to her sometime in the distant future. Also, the full potential of her psionic and speed boosts has yet to be unlocked or calculated.
