			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				So many people throughout time have been wrongfully slain, raped, and tortured. What if you could save them allâ€”at what cost? <br><br>

				The Man with No Face sought to answer questions like this; thus, he founded the Society of Black, an underground organization to watch over the timeline and to observe if any "disruptors" were on their way to change history. For the Man with No Face soon discovered that the brief victories associated with correcting the supposed wrongs of the past often meant much more trouble for the future.  <br><br>

				The Man with No Face currently sits day by day, hour by hour, and second by second in the observatory of his Time Room, waiting and watching and watching and waiting some more, ready to act to repel disturbances in quantum reality.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Man with No Face is affiliated with the Society of Black, in which he is the society's founder and current leader.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Not much is known about the Man with No Face, but it is speculated he is somewhat old. Despite this, he maintains decent speed and strength stats for his age. However, these were never his strong suits, those, instead, being his insane and calculating intellect as well as his psionic abilities. <br><br>

				These psionic abilities consist of some minor TK, but mainly his talent to foresee the future and all the possible timelines that may come to be.
