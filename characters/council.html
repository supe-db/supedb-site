			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				If there was one word to describe Rodney's life, it would be ordinary. Sure, he had the occasional run-in with peer pressure and bad behavior, but what kid his age hasn't? And because of this, Rodney's life was pretty boring, or, at least, that was true until the day he found the stone. <br> <br>

				On one random evening a magical stone fell from the sky and crashed into the forest next to where Rodney and his friends would hang out. Rodney, being the most curious and adventurous of the group, went to investigate—alone. There he found a meteorite carrying what looked like something from another world, and perhaps it did. <br> <br>

				This magical stone cursed Rodney's mind and body, granting him both the gift and the curse of the Council. The Council is a committee that sits in the middle row of a stand of seats in a virtual auditorium of the mind. Rodney stands at the center of this seemingly fictitious auditorium like a grand singer at a concert, except there is no mortal there but him. Depending on his emotional state, Rodney can summon and become one of the council members. But there is one catch: each council member represents an emotion (anger, serenity, fear…), and the members have to agree on which one of them is most appropriate for Rodney's current emotions. At the time of selection (if a selection ever happens at all), Rodney can then summon and thus become a chosen member.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Rodney is affiliated with Mac Valley High School, enrolled as a freshman. This year is supposed to be Rodney's big break.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Each council member has their own set of powers and strengths.<br> <br>

				The leader of the council is Serenity. She grants Rodney the ability of regeneration and healing of not only himself but also others around him. Serenity is the source of Rodney's mental powers and psionic stat. She also comes with a heightened sense of durability.<br> <br>

				Second in command (despite him claiming himself the leader) is Rage, a being of pure power and adrenaline. He grants Rodney the ability to fly and launch out massive blasts of plasma. He also grants Rodney exceptional durability, strength, and speed. In fact, he is the fastest of Rodney's personas, able to fly at speeds of up to Mach 10.<br> <br>

				Thirdly, there is Fear, a creature bestowing Rodney with the capacity to fly as well as haunt his victims with their impending doom. Fear also gives Rodney some minor telekinetic powers mainly intended to intimidate his opponents. Fear is also the source of Rodney's durability boost in a somewhat unconventional way in that he allows Rodney to become intangible. <br> <br>

				Besides the main three, five more members lay hidden, knocking on random doors inside Rodney's virtual auditorium, desperate to get out and become summoned.<br> <br>

				Also, there is one final thing probably worth mentioning, which is the source of Rodney's yellow stats, a wildcard by the name Unity of Emotion. This Unity only comes out when things are just right and perfectly balanced, giving Rodney powers from each member of the emotional council spectrum simultaneously and sometimes a little more (or perhaps a lot more).
