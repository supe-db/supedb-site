			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Daniel was created in a lab by a brilliant scientist by the name of Dr. Lehmann, a man who was often ridiculed by his colleagues for what they perceived as preposterous ideas. However, when Daniel was created, no one was laughing. Instead, the others began to question if Lehmann truly understood the severity of his actions. <br/><br/>

				As for Daniel, he was believed to be the first A.I. capable of emulating human consciousness, although, oddly enough, he often does not get time to express it, considering Dr. Lehmann keeps Daniel locked up in his lab for reasons Lehmann never explains. Daniel also wears a flesh suit over his metal exterior in order to blend in with the humans, or at least that's what Dr. Lehmann told him. <br/><br/>

				All of this does not really make much sense to Daniel, because as far as he is aware, he is human. Daniel never really learned of his original true purpose and that he was born from the creation of a top-secret military program ubiquitously known as DoD's Artificial NextGen Infantry Enlistment Line, or D.A.N.I.E.L. for short.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Daniel has no known affiliations aside from his alliance with Dr. Lehmann, whom Daniel perceives as his father. Lehmann's biological son, Junie, also tends to spend his free time with Daniel.			
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				A.I.'s (Daniel's alter ego) exterior is made out of thousands of layers of graphene, a bulletproof, seemingly indestructible weave of a mixture of carbon atoms formed in honeycomb-like structures. The super material can withstand bullets, tank blasts, bazookas, and even direct missile hits. It would take a nuclear detonation or a massive explosion to render A.I. inoperable.<br/><br/>

				When A.I. suits up and unleashes his original, somewhat destructive persona, his armor becomes exposed, and latches of metal from the four corners of his head protrude out and conceal his face, forming an X-like pattern at their center. At this point, A.I. is able to fire high-intensity gamma blasts in an X-like pattern seemingly from his face. <br/><br/>

				A.I. also has super intelligence, able to process information faster than any human can even imagine. His memory is also eidetic, capable of storing a seemingly limitless amount of information in the database located in his head. <br/><br/>

				Despite his incredible processing speeds and unrivaled ability to compute, he often lacks the creativity and ingenuity of some of his human counterparts. As a side note, A.I.'s processor is so fast that he is able to break AES 128-bit encryption in a matter of minutes, something modern human computers can't even come close to. <br/><br/>

				A.I.'s speed is propelled by mini repulsive engines attached to his legs and arms. They give him devastatingly fast, quick bursts of speed, but he sometimes has to recalibrate and recover after launching a high-speed attack, hence explaining why his speed stat has a yellow marker. As for strength, A.I. has a built-in hydraulic thrust system, allowing him to lift objects over ten tons.
