			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				After the <i>incident</i> otherwise known as the Storm of Light, Vex Krueger was granted a gift, and not just any gift, but the ability to change locations at instantaneous speeds. In other words, he was a teleporter. And although the Storm of Light seemingly stripped the planet of billions of people, it happened just as Vex was about to be put down by the lethal wraith and high voltage of an electric chair. <br><br>

				In a way, Vex was the only person saved by the Storm of Light, which seemed to make Vex awfully grateful for the new post-apocalyptic society it brought forth. And so, Vex sought to keep it that way, to keep the world in a state of chaos, a society where he and his companions, the Survivors, could run free and do whatever the f@*k they pleased.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Vex Krueger is affiliated with the Survivors, of which he is their leader. The Survivors is a group of metahumans that formed after the apocalyptic event known as the Storm of Light. Their purpose is simpleâ€”keep the world the way it is, in a state of pandemonium with no rules, laws, or regulations. In other words, Vex craves an anarchical utopia and thus seeks to stop all those who try to wreck the world with <i>society</i>.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Like most metahumans, Vex has enhanced strength, speed, and durability. He also often wears a heavily padded motorcycle helmet (with a painted-on smile) and a motorcycle vest, but those are more for style than anything else. Vex also has a good working knowledge of cars, motorcycles, and other motorized vehicles because he had worked as a mechanic in his prior life. <br><br>

				Vex has a small psionics buff derived from the mind games and mental confusion his superhuman abilities bring. <br><br>

				Lastly, the Incident of Light bestowed upon Vex the gift of instantaneous teleportation; hence, his yellow stat booster indicates his speed is that of light. However, this teleportation power is not derived from the conventional; instead, when Vex teleports, he is transported to another world, another dimension even. This unknown realm is timeless; in other words, it has no concept of time, and thus none passes, although it does share the same physical existence as the real world without interacting with it in the slightest.<br><br> 

				So, Vex can enter this timeless realm, disappear, run to another point in the timeless realm (which corresponds with the real physical world), and then exit the timeless realm back into normal reality, with the overall effect giving the illusion that Vex can teleport. So when it comes down to it, the incident really bestowed upon Vex the ability to enter this <i>other</i> world and not so much the ability to teleport. <br><br>

				One final note is that, for some reason, the incident also seemed to change Vex's eye color to red.
