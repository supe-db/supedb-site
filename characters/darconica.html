			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				So many worlds conquered, so many civilizations wiped off the face of their planet. All of this was at the hands of a madman, a being of pure darkness, of relentless hate, and eternal torment. Some say this man, Darconica, was mortal once, but whatever mortality he once had was torn, ripped, and obliterated out of him thousands of years ago.<br><br>

				Darconica leads an army of undead soldiers and demons from the underworld, but rarely does he ever need to call upon their hand, as the wraith of his power is more than any hero could ever handle.<br><br> 

				The source of Darconica's power is the Destiny Stalker blade, the most powerful darkness weapon and most unstoppable weapon in general in all of medieval reality. A single swipe of the blade into a planet's terrestrial body can explode the planet into millions of pieces. 
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Darconica commands an Army of Darkness. Fire breathers, ice demons, lava golems, demented goblins, corrupted humans, possessed warriors, and the like all serve Darconica to their demise. A few dragons are also at Darconica's disposal, although many of them have not grown too fond of him, as he often uses their kin's rotting corpses to make weapons and equipment for himself and his army.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				It is believed that despite all of Darconica's powers and abilities, none of them derive from the man himself; instead, they come from his equipment.<br><br> 

				First and foremost is his Destiny Stalker Blade, the most powerful weapon in all of medieval reality. The sword has an eyeball located on its pommel that constantly moves around, examining its surroundings and reporting back to Darconica telepathically on what it observes.<br><br> 

				Darconica's armor is made of dragon hide, an extremely durable material resistant to great falls and spurts of flames (dragons had adopted this type of flesh after constant fiery battles with other dragons). But it is not any normal form of dragon hide, as it was cursed with black magic by a dark wizard some centuries ago, making it (as often stated with Darconica's other equipment) one of the strongest, if not the strongest, piece of armor in medieval existence. Note, this armor can survive blasts capable of exploding planets.
