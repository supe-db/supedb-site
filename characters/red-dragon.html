			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Guilty! Two life sentences without the possibility of parole a judge decreed on Nathan, who had just been convicted for a double murder, a heinous crime he did not commit. Nathan knew that, his lawyer knew that, and his wife and six-year-old son would have known that too if they were still alive.<br><br>

				The pair had been prematurely taken from Nathan, slaughtered by a criminal in the middle of the night, and then Nathan was framed for the killings. He had lost everything: his life's work, his family, his aspirations, his livelihood, & his freedom, all in one bad day. The judge locked him up, his lawyer had failed him, the prosecutor had stripped away the life of an innocent man, and the system was broken. Nathan had but one choice now; he needed to take revenge on—everyone.<br><br>

				He decided that the new ways of society were broken, and the only thing he could do to restore the world was to bring back a little tradition and a little personality from his ancestors' history, an alter ego—the fury of a Red Dragon.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Nathan is affiliated with Livingston & Co., as its owner also had some problems with the justice system. The owner just needed someone with nothing to lose to enforce his bidding.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Nathan has no powers or supernatural abilities, although he does have strong engineering knowledge, advanced sword training, and has mastered many forms of martial arts. He also wears body armor, and he carries pistols with him just in case things get testy.
