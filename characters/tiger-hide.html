			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zangief Draco was a natural-born killer. A hunter of all things exotic and of all things deadly. But Zangief's prize, the gem among gems, was the tiger, the strongest of the cats, with the sharpest teeth, the most powerful bite clocking in at about 1,000 pounds per square inch, and with the largest frame. <br><br>

				But there was one catch: Zangief never used guns, explosives, or even bows to hunt; instead, he only used his hands, a few knives, and his semi-insane persona. And after many years in the pursuit of one majestic tiger beauty, he finally did it. He had beaten, captured, and slain his ultimate prize, but it came with the ultimate cost. As the tiger Zangief killed was the favorite pet of a witch, a sorceress of pure evil and endless vengeance. <br><br>

				And so, the witch cast a spell on Zangief to become the beast that he had spent years hunting, for it was time for the hunter to become the hunted, to learn what it was like to be endlessly pursued for sport or for no reason at all.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zangief is affiliated with the Syndicate, a group of supervillains that decided to form a league of their own. Instead of trying to kill heroes as one man, the villains decided it would probably be best to join forces and do it together.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Zangief is a mutant tiger humanoid-like creature, but he is not from Animaliax like so many other animal-man-like beasts. Instead, his powers were not derived from genetic mutations but from witchcraft. <br><br>

				As a man-tiger, Zangief has superior speed, strength, and a sense of smell. His durability is also immense, greatly enhanced by his thick hide. Zangief even packs a fully loaded bazooka with him at all times just in case things get a little spicy. But this is not all of Zangief's powers. <br><br>

				Well, at first it was, but that was before he was enhanced by the syndicate to become a mutant-tiger-machine hybrid. With it, the source of his yellow stats was derived. His metal flesh and force field now generated outside his body add to his durability. Zangief's newly received energy cannon is able to fire blasts deadly enough to rival early human atomic bombs. The computer added to his brain allows him to process information at astonishing speeds and predict his foe's next move quite efficiently. The upgraded armor also gives Zangief some brief and often handy telekinetic abilities, able to pull his foes to him with a gravitational thrust. Finally, Zangief can now move at speeds over Mach 1, and his strength has increased nearly fiftyfold.
