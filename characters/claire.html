            <h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Claire was born and grew up in a middle-class family a few miles from Berlin, Germany. When she was in her mid-twenties, she fell in love with an American soldier by the name of Patrick Preston. Despite her parentsâ€™ best wishes, she sought to start her life with him in America. <br><br>

                At first, everything was great. Claire secured a job, and Patrick was making money as a security guard at a few high-profile clubs after retiring from the military. A few months later, they decided to adopt an eleven-year-old boy by the name of Michael shortly after Claire was deemed infertile by her physician. <br><br>

                As the years went on, however, Patrick got into deep with the sharks as his gambling addiction began to consume both his mind and body. Upon his passing, Claire was left alone with no job and a son who was very dependent and unusually hungry for someone so small.
            </p>
            <h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Claire is a member of the custodial team located in Springfield High School. She also has an independent business cleaning homes of wealthy people on the weekends. She is an avid Christian attending Mass every Sunday and a Church book club with her prayer group every other Saturday.<br><br>

                When it comes to family, she and her adopted son Michael are the last two belonging to the Preston family lineage.
