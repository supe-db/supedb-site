			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Before there were smartphones, the internet, airplanes, and cars, and even before the first human being walked the earth, there was Sha Sham Che, one man, or rather, one extraordinary someone. For Sha Sham was not human. He was merely an alien from another world who adopted the appearance of a human to blend in. And so, soon after his arrival on Earth, the most magnificent planet sourcing life in his eyes, Sha Sham decided to construct a world of his own, an Earth-esque planet. He would later name this world Battleworld Earth, a place that Sha Sham ruled, a location where his word was law and his wrath was justice. <br><br>

				For this new Earth-like planet, it somewhat resembled Earth, although it was a fraction of the size, and it was constructed for one purpose and 1 purpose alone. You see, Sha Sham had grown tired of his seemingly endless triumphs over his adversaries, over worldly problems, and even over death, so recently he sought only 1 thingâ€”entertainment.<br><br>

				Sha Sham's life purpose was now to entertain himself in ways he had never done before. And for him, the most invigorating form of entertainment was showmanship, adrenalized combatants, and a little bit of stakes, sort of like the Roman Colosseums of the days of old but on a much <i>grander</i> scale. <br><br>

				And with this goal, Sha Sham's planet became Battleworld Earth, an arena world, a land with changing environments and textures that could house some of the strongest superheroes (and even supervillains) in all the galaxy and perhaps beyond, for them all to duke it out in one <i>grand</i>, gut-wrenching slugfest. And if the combatants refuse to comply, their world will be obliterated by Sha Sham's weapons of entertainment. <br><br>

				No big deal...
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Sha Sham is affiliated with Battleworld Earth, in which he runs the planet on a tight shift. When Battleworld Earth isn't being used to force superheroes from across the galaxy to fight to their death, it is being cleaned up and prepared for the next great tournament. <br><br>

				See, Sha Sham's Battleworld Earth isn't just for hawkish brawls, as it also houses some of the deadliest and most notorious supervillains in the universe. In a way, the planet acts as a highly secure and seemingly impenetrable galactic prison. And thus, Sha Sham is also considered a galactic warden in that he forces his inmates to keep his planet nice and tidy.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				When Sha Sham is hosting great battles between champions from across the galaxy, he takes on a more fun but yet much more ruthless alternate persona known as the Grand Inquisitor, supervisor and administrator of the Battle Games. Here, Sha Sham, now the Grand Inquisitor, dons his green ivory robes laced with a <i>tad</i> amount of gold. <br><br>

				The Grand Inquisitor gets his superior strength, durability, and size (and to a certain extent his speed) from his DNA, in other words, his ancestral line, but none of these capabilities compare to his nearly limitless intellect. See, the Grand Inquisitor's genetic makeup helps with that too, but even for his people, the Grand Inquisitor is one of the smartest, if not the smartest, among them. And he certainly is the one (among them) with the most experience, battle experience that is. <br><br>

				The Grand Inquisitor has been learning and experimenting with various technologies (of his own design) for so many thousands of years that he was able to build and terraform his own planet, develop lasers powerful enough to explode other planets from far distances away (or send out his remote drones if targets are too far), and design force fields to contain some of the most powerful beings in the universe. <br><br>

				The Grand Inquisitor has even developed "shock collars" strong enough to kill or seriously maim any worthy or <i>brave</i> hero who dares try to escape. And if that all fails, the Grand Inquisitors Hydron, supercharged gravity-generating devices, will be sure to keep any super being grounded.<br><br>

				And one last note: when it comes to the Grand Inquisitor, things are not always what they seem.
