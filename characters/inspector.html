			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				It all began when the inspector responsible for protecting the region encompassing the planet Valgar passed away. With this inspector out of the picture, no one remained to prevent supernatural creatures from the underworld from leaking out into the physical world and unleashing havoc on the living.<br><br> 

				The Agents of Order needed a new member, and that member was chosen to be Mathew Silverstone, a man who had no one, no family, no life of his own, and no jobâ€”someone who had no prior convictions. Someone who could risk it all, abandoning his past life to start another, to be reborn as an inspector.<br><br>

				Mathew Silverstone was slated to become Inspector 9, the final and most difficult position as compared to the other nine. Now you might be asking, why was Mathew chosen when there were probably millions of lonely human duds just like him? And you would be right, because Matthew had the same exact question.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Matthew is affiliated with the Agents of Order, a group of nine inspectors set out to protect the physical world from the supernatural. Each member is given a range of planets housing life to look after and protect from any unsettling creatures that may be seeking widespread domination.<br><br>

				Matthew, being the newest member of the Order, is often scolded and looked down upon as nothing more than a mistake.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Matthew's inspector status granted him superhuman strength, speed, and an insane persistence ability strong enough to allow one to walk away from a direct nuclear explosion, unscathed and unharmed. The inspector status also gave Matthew the ability to project auras of light, which are high-powered, supercharged bursts of energy that are super effective against demonic opponents. In addition, they also can do a great deal of damage to living opponents.<br><br>

				In the realm of psionics, Matthew has the power to read people's minds, inject thoughts into people's heads, and also control people's actions through his "puppeteering ability". Matthew can also track and sense supernatural beings through their scent, which gives off a 5th-dimensional signal on the astral plane. Finally, Matthew can open gateways between his world and other much darker dimensions if he so chooses.
