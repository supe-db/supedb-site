			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Little is known about Future, who they are, where they come from, and why they do the things they do. All that is known is Future was, is, and always will be the bane of Michael Preston's existence, his biggest foe, his one true nemesis, and the bad to his good.</br></br>

				It was said that Future was born in darkness some hundred years ago, trapped in a cage like an animal, slowly clawing and scratching their way out. This was due to the fact that Future was a subject of great experimentation and genetic testing in the heart of early 1940s Germany.</br></br>

				One of the most extraordinary things about Future is not their discovery of the ability to time travel, but the fact that time travel to the future was thought to be impossible, inconceivable, and inconsequential, and Future was the only one to achieve this feat.</br></br>
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Future was a former member of the Society of Black, an underground time travel prevention organization run by <i>the Man with No Face</i>, a man whose head is covered completely in medical wrappings.</br></br>

				The goal of the Society of Black is to monitor and prevent others from time traveling in order to avoid the consequences of the butterfly effect, the grandfather paradox, or any other quantum, spacetime continuum-altering events that could unravel the very core of the universe, destroying all of existence and other small things like that. 
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Future wears a black, highly technical war suit that glows a haunting red and is durable enough to survive a bazooka blast. Future's strength and speed rival or vastly exceed any mere man, leading many to question whether Future is even human. Future can sprint at speeds reaching 38 miles per hour. Their lifting strength is just over 1 thousand pounds.</br></br>

				Future also has the ability to travel through time to the past, back to the present, and beyond. Future makes use of small spherical psionic devices that tend to distort their victim's balance and sense of motion.</br></br>

				Future's suit is able to generate two high-powered beams of red photon energy, which they can then blast out of the palms of their hands.
