			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Some thousand years ago in the Kingdom of Ali lived a great warrior; many would even say a legendary one, a man who could lift twelve tons over his head and run and fight at speeds approaching 100 miles per hour. <br><br>

				By his side, he held the legendary shield in one hand and (you guessed it) the legendary sword in another. Now, those were not the official names for the equipment, but that is what the people of Ali called them. <br><br>

				The legendary warrior went on to spend hundreds of years battling the darkest and most vile creatures that emerged from the Valley of Doom into the kingdom, protecting it like his own life and the lives of his family depended on it (because often they did). The legendary warrior fought off the likes of fire-breathing dragons, deadly fanged serpents, man-sized bat creatures, and many other terrible monsters, and he always emerged victorious. But that was until one sad day came to be when Darconica came from the sky to capture the legendary warrior's bride.<br><br>

				In overwhelming anger, the legendary warrior went off on a journey to retrieve his long-lost love from Darconica and to fight him to the death, vowing to return with Darconica's head on a platter. But unfortunately for the Legendary Warrior, he never returned, and he was never heard from again.<br><br>

				This tale seemed to begin the tradition of Darconica raiding kingdoms in order to sweep the king's or prince's love away, leaving them nothing to do but hide away like a fool, a fool who failed the kingdom.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The legendary warrior is associated with an ancient version of the Kingdom of Ali, thousands of years before the heir to his great bloodline, Prince Roman, came to be.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The legendary warrior is Arathorian, meaning he naturally possesses the strength, speed, and stamina that greatly exceed those of a human. <br><br>

				His armor is made of pure adamantite, a material that would make modern bullets look like Tic-Tacs if they dared brush against its surface. The plume on the back of the legendary warrior's helmet is sewn from the feathers of a phoenix.<br><br>

				Although the armaments possessed by the legendary warrior were famously referred to as the legendary sword and legendary shield, no official evidence of what the items were or what made up their composition actually exists.
