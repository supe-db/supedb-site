			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Flame Emperor Dragon was born in an age where few creatures dare make their presence known in the face of giant, carnivorous dinosaurs. T-Rexes, Velociraptors, and Triceratops stretched across the land as far as terrestrial passages would allow. No one thought about challenging them until the day of the "meteor," as many modern scientists like to put it. But for those who know better, there was never any meteor; instead, the end of the dinosaurs was the day the Flame Emperor Dragon visited Earth. This beast of flame was no ordinary creature, as it was and still is the strongest fire-based creature in all magical existence. One of its breaths burnt and shredded entire continents of Earth to bits, only leaving those alive that were burrowed far beneath the ground.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Flame Emperor Dragon has no known affiliations at this time. He sometimes has battles with other elemental creatures of great power, like with Quake, the Living Seism, but these occasions are long in between and fleeting due to the damage the conflict could wage on a planet.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				The Flame Emperor Dragon has a thick hide capable of withstanding nuclear explosions. He can produce a flame hot enough and strong enough to melt a continent in one long, sweeping blaze. His intellect is above the average for any being, especially for that of a dragon, since dragons typically rely on their brawn and not their brain. <br><br>

				The intimidation factor of the Flame Emperor Dragon's sheer size plays into his slight psionic stat boost. <br><br> 

				The Flame Emperor Dragon is able to fight but especially fly at devastingly fast speeds. His strength is also rivaled by few, as he is capable of lifting boulders that weigh upwards of 100 tons. Finally, the Flame Emperor Dragon is the most powerful fire-based creature, giving him dominion over all other flame-type creatures, beings, and weapons (mostly).
