			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Ben was a pretty hardworking man. He put himself through college studying aerospace engineering. Upon graduation, he dodged a few lucrative career offers and opted to join the military instead. There he tried out for and soon became a fighter pilot. Soon after his arrival, he earned the nickname <i>Ace</i> for his superior flying and sharp shooting skills. <br/><br/>

				After nearly 20 years of service, he again took another drastic and somewhat deadly career turn. Ben signed up for Sky Force, a privately owned space and exploration company. <br/><br/>

				After finishing near the top of the qualifications, he was two spots away from making the force, so he cut his losses and decided to put his major to use. <br/><br/>

				That was until two other higher-ranking candidates bailed out, lining Ben right up for the position as if it were destiny. If only destiny were this cruel, as his first voyage to space resulted in the eruption of a black hole and the near destruction of his ship. <br/> <br/>

				Everything went dark after that as Ben found himself hurtling through the pit of space right towards it.
			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Ben is affiliated with Sky Force due to his brief service there as a pilot. His first and only trip led him on a journey to achieve a world recordâ€”the nearest proximity a person was ever to a black hole. This exploration was done to observe and study the black hole better; unfortunately for Ben, things didn't quite go as planned, as one disruptive explosion threw the ship off course. 
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Dark Matter's speed buff is due to his ability to open portals that can be used for teleportation.<br/> <br/>

				In times of deep concentration and relaxation, Dark Matter can also summon the will to bring forth a black hole to his proximity, explaining the yellow marker boost for psionics. Aside from that, Dark Matter's normal abilities include super strength, superior speed, and the ability to fly. Dark Matter can also summon and create wormholes at will (as mentioned previously), allowing him to travel over enormous distances faster than the speed of light, but he can also pull other objects toward him or even jam his fist through a portal placed conveniently near his enemies' heads. Dark Matter also has the power others have deemed <i>Eyes of the Universe</i> where Dark Matter can view all places he has been before, if just for a moment. <br/> <br/>

				Due to Dark Matter's encounters with so many vast explosions, his skin has grown tough, capable of withstanding deadly cosmic radiation from the depths of space.
