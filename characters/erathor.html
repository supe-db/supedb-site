			<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Erathor is the son of a king, the leader of an army, and the preserver of his birthline. His people look up to him, often referring to him as Erathor the Noble or Erathor the Hero. His darling bride-to-be also admires him in an almost boundless way, as do his proud parents, as all of them rule the Kingdom of Za together... <br><br>

				Okay, you got me; this is sounding familiar, isn't it? <br><br>

				Well, maybe that's because it is all too similar. <br><br>

				For Prince Erathor was born across the land in the same year, in the same month, and in the same week as another prince, a Prince Roman to be specific. The two boys, Roman and Erathor, grew up in rival kingdoms that were constantly in a cold war. But even if their respective castles weren't at arms, the boys would still be. They were destined to show each other up back and forth for seemingly forever. <br><br>

				In a way, and lucky for Erathor, he seemed to always be one step ahead of his Kingdom of Ali counterpart, being just a little faster, or a little stronger, or a little smarter (or whatever it took). For, unlike Roman, Erathor was almost perfect, and he was also much kinder than Roman and so much more pleasurable to listen to. Just ask all the people who would sacrifice their afternoon just to hear Erathor read poetry.<br><br>

				But it was not all good for Erathor because, unfortunately, on the day Darconica had destroyed Roman and the Kingdom of Ali, he had also destroyed Erathor's kingdom a few hours prior, leaving Erathor alive to suffer a fate worse than death: to live in a world where all his loved ones were gone and he was not, but left defenseless instead.

			</p>
			<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Erathor is affiliated with the Kingdom of Za, in which he serves as the eldest prince and rightful heir to the throne. The nearest border kingdom to the Kingdom of Za is the Kingdom of Ali.
			</p>
			<h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
			<p>
				Erathor gains his sensational strength and breathtaking speed from his almost ideal upbringing but mostly due to the fact that his race, Arathorians, are naturally much stronger and faster than any human could be. His flesh is also much thicker and his bones much harder than a human's for the same reason.<br><br>

				Also, do not let Erathor's seemingly low stats fool you, as Erathor gets his strength, his speed, and his power from the magical items he collects along his quest to find Darconcia, reclaim his bride, and avenge his kingdom (again, this is sounding quite familiar, isn't it?).
