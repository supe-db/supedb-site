            <h1>Origins</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                This device was created by Michael Preston in his lab with the help of cutting edge tech from New World Technologies. Michael stole most of the materials he needed to build the device much like his other <i>inventions</i>. But, who can blame him, one man having some many innovations in a world with hundreds of technological company giants is unrealistic. The time machine's exact origin is unknown because although it was created by Michael, a lot of luck & coincidences got it to reach a working state. To use, a tester must insert an image from the time & location they want to travel to in the device and then turn the dial the machine's front panel to the appropriate power level.
            </p>
            <h1>Powers & Abilities</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The device grants the user the capability to travel back to the time & place in which a photo was taken.
            </p>
            <h1>Limitations</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                The device is easily damaged even by normal use. It takes an absurd amount of power to be operational whatsoever & it requires the most expensive element known to mankind to run, Francium. Francium is an element that is estimated to cost in the millions & is only obtained by large technological super giants that not only can afford to obtain and store the material at near absolute zero, but must retain authorization by the U.S. government to use it at all.
                When activated the time machine does transport a user into the past but only temporarily depending on the amount of Francium and power level supplied to the device upon activation. The time frame one can remain in the past is also linearly related to have far a subject went back in time.
