            <p>
                Earth is nearly round in shape. It is almost a sphere, however, it is slightly flattened at the poles & bulging at the equator. It is composed of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a semi-solid mantle, and a solid crust. Its land consists of mountains, valleys, plains, & plateaus. Earth contains an atmosphere which consists mainly of Nitrogen and Oxygen. To its inhabitants, Earth is the only known planet with water on its surface.
            </p>
            <h1>Residents</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Earth is vastly dominanted by the Apex species known as Homo-Sapien (humans). Humans greatly exceed the secondary population (the group that were to become dominant if humans became extinct) by billions of individuals. Humans are also the only group capable of continuous innovations and technological advancements. With these advancements, humans greately exceed any other species on the planet in military might.<br><br>
                Signifcant inventions & discoveries intially included stone tools, fire, huts, clothing, spears, bows & arrows, harpoons, etc. Harpoons unlike spears are designed with barbs at the end to prevent marine life from escaping its grasp. Later came the wheel, writing systems, argiculture, metallurgy, navigation tools, & mathmatics. Current inventions include printing press, steam engine, light bulb, telephone, automobile, airplane, computer, internet, & various medical advancements.<br><br>
                Apes, on the other hand, are limited to primitive tool use like using rocks as hammers, sticks as shovels, and leaves as <i>buckets</i> to gather water. Despite apes significantly less use of technology, they do outrun humans reaching speeds of 34mph as opposed to humans 28mph. Gorillas (a species of ape) are also 4-10 times stronger than the average human with the ability to lift over 1800 pounds.
