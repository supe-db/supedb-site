            <h1>Physical</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Earth is nearly round in shape. It is almost a sphere; however, it is slightly flattened at the poles & bulging at the equator. It is composed of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a semi-solid mantle, and a solid crust. Its land consists of mountains, valleys, plains, & plateaus. Earth contains an atmosphere that consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. To its inhabitants, Earth is the only known planet with water on its surface.
            </p>
            <h1>Residents</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Earth is vastly dominated by the apex species known as Homo sapiens (humans). Humans greatly exceed the secondary population (the group that was to become dominant if humans became extinct) by billions of individuals. Humans are also the only group capable of continuous innovations and technological advancements. With these advancements, humans greatly exceed any other species on the planet in military might.<br><br>

                Significant inventions & discoveries initially included stone tools, fire, huts, clothing, spears, bows & arrows, harpoons, etc. Harpoons, unlike spears, are designed with barbs at the end to prevent marine life from escaping its grasp. Later came the wheel, writing systems, agriculture, metallurgy, navigation tools, & mathematics. Current inventions include the printing press, steam engine, light bulb, telephone, automobile, airplane, computer, internet, & various medical advancements.<br><br>

                Apes, on the other hand, are limited to primitive tool use like using rocks as hammers, sticks as shovels, and leaves as <i>buckets</i> to gather water. Despite apes significantly less use of technology, they do outrun humans, reaching speeds of 34 mph as opposed to humans 28 mph. Gorillas (a species of ape) are also 4-10 times stronger than the average human, with the ability to lift over 1800 pounds.

            <h1>Location</h1><hr/>
            <p>
                Earth is located in the Milky Way Galaxy. There are at least 250 to 500 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. On average, every star is orbited by at least one planet. There are 700+ multiplanetary systems in the Milky Way galaxy.
