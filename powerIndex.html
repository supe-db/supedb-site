      <h2>Threat Level</h2><hr/>
      <p>
        Threat level depicts what range of a threat would a subject gone rogue exert. These estimates assume groupings have a normal distribution of military personnel throughout a civilian population. In order in severity the threat levels are: None, Average, District-Wide, City-Wide, State-Level, National Security-Threat, Continental Threat, Planetary-Threat, Star-System Buster, Galaxy Buster, & Universal Buster. Threat levels correspond to a range of 0-10 respectively. See diagram (above) which depicts the current percentages of threat levels currently known.
      </p>

      <br><h2> Class</h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        The class defines where a subject derives their skillset from. Currently, the three main sources of power attainment is from tech, meta capabilities, and magic. See diagram (above) for distribution of currently known power-set classes.
      </p>

      <br><h2> Intelligence</h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The intelligence of a subject is defined by their memory capacity, mental processing speed, overall brain wiring (leading to things like high level planning and problem solving), concentration, & the extent of their obtained knowledge. For simplicity, intelligence will be defined in terms of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) but may not be exact depending on the willpower and obtained knowledge of a subject. As a reference, humans have an average IQ as defined by Level 2. Each list item below corresponds to a unique level.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficent</b>: IQ is measured at less than 85.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: IQ is between 85-115.</li>
      	<li><b>Smart</b>: IQ is between 116-130.</li>
      	<li><b>Exceptional</b>: IQ is between 131-160.</li>
      	<li><b>Gifted</b>:  IQ is between 161-200.</li>
      	<li><b>Highly Gifted</b>: IQ is between 200-300.</li>
      	<li><b>Genius</b>: IQ is between 300-500.</li>
      	<li><b>Super Genius</b>: IQ is between 500-1000.</li>
      	<li><b>Beyond Genius</b>: IQ is between 1000-5000.</li>
      	<li><b>All-Knowing</b>: IQ is greater than 5000.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Strength </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The strength of a subject is defined by their ability to lift heavy objects, as where as there capacity to crush, and present force. For simplicity, this skillset will be measured in pounds & tons. Note, the largest object lifted by humans was the North Rankin B. Drilling platform which weighed over 50 million pounds.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficent</b>: Lifting ability is less than 300 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: Lifting ability is between 300-500 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Strong</b>: Lifting ability is between 501-1000 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Strongman</b>: Lifting ability is between 1001-1999 lbs.</li>
      	<li><b>Apex</b>: Lifting ability is between 1-10 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Enhanced</b>: Lifting ability is between 10-50 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Super </b>: Lifting ability is between 50-100 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Ultra </b>: Lifting ability is between 100-1000 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Mega</b>: Lifting ability is between 1000-25000 tons.</li>
      	<li><b>Limitless</b>: Lifting ability is greater than 25000 tons.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Speed </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The speed of a subject is their ability to run, fly, teleport, move, or fight fast. For simplicilty, speed will be measured by overall velocity and will be quantified in mph (miles per hour), machs, & units based off of the speed of light. Subjects who can manipulate or slow down time will also have their stats reflected in the "speed" category. Note, the fastest a human has ever traveled was just under 25,000 mph & it was achieved during the Apollo 10 mission. Mach speed is defined by the ability to break the sound barrier. The speed of light is over 870,000 times the speed of sound.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficent</b>: Sprinting ability is less than 15mph.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: Sprinting ability is between 15-20mph.</li>
      	<li><b>Olympian</b>: Sprinting ability is between 21-30mph.</li>
      	<li><b>Apex</b>: Sprinting ability is between 31-100mph.</li>
      	<li><b>Subsonic</b>: Sprinting ability is between 100mph-mach1.</li>
      	<li><b>Super-Sonic</b>: Sprinting ability is between mach1-mach10.</li>
      	<li><b>Speedster </b>: Sprinting ability is between mach10-mach100.</li>
      	<li><b>Super Speedster</b>: Sprinting ability is between mach100-mach1000.</li>
      	<li><b>Omega Level Speedster</b>: Sprinting ability is between mach1000-mach10,000.</li>
      	<li><b>Lightspeed+</b>: Sprinting ability is between mach10,000-lightspeed & beyond.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Durability </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
      	The durability of a subject is the ability to withstand combat, energy-based, or explosive-based attacks. This also includes the ability to regenerate, withstand mental manipulations, resist electrical attacks, subvert excessive ammunitions, etc. For simplicilty, this skillset will be measured in psi (pound force per square inch) which is the force per unit area (lbf/in^2). Earth's atmosphere is measured in at just under 15psi. 
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Deficent</b>: Can withstand less than 75psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Average</b>: Can withstand between 75-800psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Fighter</b>: Can withstand between 800-1500psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Apex</b>: Can withstand between 1500-10,00psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Bulletproof</b>: Can withstand between 10,000-70,000psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Enhanced</b>: Can withstand between 70,000-500,000psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Nuclear </b>: Can withstand between 500,000-1,500,000psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Planetary</b>: Can withstand between 1.5mil - 100 quindecillion psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Nearly Indestructible</b>: Can withstand between 100 quindecillion- 1 googol psi of pressure.</li>
      	<li><b>Immortal</b>: Can withstand over 1 googol of pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Energy Manipulation </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        This is defind as the ability to output, absorb, or modify energy. Energy can be emitted in the form of light, explosions, electricity, pyrotechnics, bullets, crossbows, or also by throwing massive objects. Energy will be measured in foot-pounds (ft lbs) which is the amount of energy required to apply a force of 1 pound over a foot distance. For larger energy outputs, tons of TNT will be used. This will mainly be applied to output energy for damage but energy absorption capabilities will also be considered. Note, the most powerful nuclear bomb aka the Tsar Bomb emitted 50 megatons of TNT.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deficent</b>: Can emit less than 35ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Average</b>: Can emit between 35-90ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Gunslinger</b>: Can emit between 90-15,000ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Rocketeer</b>: Can emit between 15,001-2,500,000ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Tank</b>: Can emit between 2,500,001-5,000,000ft·lbs of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamo</b>: Can emit between 5,000,001ft·lbs - 1kiloton of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Nuclear</b>: Can emit between 1kiloton-50Megatons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Continental</b>: Can emit between 50Megatons-1 quadrillion tons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Planetary</b>: Can emit between 1 quadrillion - 1 nonillion tons of energy.</li>
        <li><b>Star-Destroyer+</b>: Can emit over 1 nonillion tons of energy.</li>
      </ul>

      <br><h2> Mental Powers </h2><hr/>
      <p> 
        This skillset is defined by ones ability to use telekinesis, gravitational force manipulation, electro-magnetic force manipulation, read minds, perform mind control on a subject, etc. For simplicity, this output will mainly pertain to external manipulations via exerting a force and will be measured in pound-force (lbf). Pound-force is the amount of force required to move a pound equal to that of the gravitional acceleration produced by Earth.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>None</b>: Subject pososses no mental abilities .</li>
